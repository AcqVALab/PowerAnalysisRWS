# Introduction{-}

This tutorial introduces power analysis for determining sample size using R with the aim of informing about the theoretical underpinnings, showcasing how to perform power analysis, and enabling participants on how to adapt, change, and modify data sets so that they can be fed into a power analysis using the `simr` [@simr]. 

```{r diff, echo=FALSE, out.width= "15%", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://slcladal.github.io/images/gyr_chili.jpg")
```

This tutorial is aimed at intermediate users of R. The aim is not to provide a fully-fledged guide but rather to show and exemplify how to perform a power analysis for a generalized linear mixed-effects modelas this is the most common type of analysis for experimental studies.

## What to do before the workshop{-}

To get the most out of this workshop, you will need to have some (basic) R skills and (basic) knowledge of how to work with R, RStudio, R Projects, and R Notebooks. If you have no or little experience with this or if you need to refresh your skills, please carefully read (or optimally go through) these tutorials:

* [Getting started with R](https://slcladal.github.io/intror.html)

* [Handling tables in R](https://slcladal.github.io/table.html)

Before attending the workshop, you need to install the following packages in RStudio:

* `here` (for easy pathing)

* `tidyverse` (for data processing)

* `pwr` (for simple power analyses)

* `lme4` (for mixed-models)

* `sjPlot` (for summaries of mixed-models)

* `report` (for reporting mixed-models)

* `simr` (for power analyses for glmms)

* `knitr` (for knitting R Notebooks)

* `markdown` (for rendering Rmd files)

* `rmarkdown`  (for R Markdown formatting)

* `installr` (for updating R)


You can update R and install these packages by clicking on `packages` on the top of the lower right pane in RStudio or you can execute the following code in the lower left, `Console` pane of RStudio. 

```{r install, eval = F, message=F, warning=F}
# update R
#install.packages("installr")
#library(installr)
#updateR()
# install required packages
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "here",  "pwr", "lme4", "sjPlot", "report", "simr", "DescTools", "Hmisc"), 
                 dependencies = T)
```


**It is really important that you have knowledge of R and RStudio and that you have installed the packages before the workshop so that we do not have to deal with technical issues too much.**

You can find a more detailed version of the content of this workshop in these two LADAL tutorials

* [Power Analysis with R](https://slcladal.github.io/pwr.html)

You can follow this workshop in different ways - you can sit back and watch it like a lecture or take a more active role - that said, the intention for this workshop is clearly to be practical so that I show something and then you do it on you computer and we have exercises where you can try out what you have just learned.

So, in essence, there are the following three options for following this workshop:

1. You can sit back and enjoy and focus on what you see and then go back home and try it by yourself later.

2. You can follow this workshop in RStudio and execute code, see what it does, understand it, and adapt it. This requires some skills in R and RStudio - although I have trued to keep things simple.

3. You can click on [this link]() which takes you to a Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab (and you are then ready to go - you only  have to install the packages which takes a couple of minutes). You can then copy that Notebook and save it in your own Google Drive and then execute code, modify it, and understand it. This does require less skills and will be easier for people who just want to focus on the code that produces certain visualizations without doing it in RStudio. Also, this get rid of most technical issues (hopefully) but the installation of packages will take a while and you will need to re-install the packages every time you want to re-use the Jupyter Notebook.

Choose which option suits you best and then go with it. 

## Timeline{-}

Here is what we have planned to cover in this workshop:

Tuesday, January 25, 10-12am

* Introduction

* Primer

* Session preparation

* How to load different data formats into R

* Theoretical underpinning

* Basics of data preparation 

* Getting started with pwr

# Getting started{-}

If you choose option 2, you need to set up our R session and prepare our R project at the very beginning of the workshop. 

For everything to work, please do the following:

* Create a folder for this workshop somewhere on your computer, e.g. called *AcqVA_DataVisR_WS*

* In that folder, create two subfolders called *data* and *images*

* Open RStudio, go to File > New Project > Existing Directory (Browse to project folder) > Create (and hit Enter)

This will then create an R Project in the project folder.


## Theoretical underpinning{-}


What is power and why do we need power analyses?

Let's have a look at some distributions to understand what is going on...

## Effect size{-}

And let's start with varying effect size.


```{r same, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
distplot <- function(mean1, mean2, sd1, n, pop = "two different populations", d = 0, effect = "no", ylim = 0.06, seed = 123){
options(scipen = 999)
library(tidyverse)
library(DescTools)
set.seed(seed)
data.frame(time = c(rnorm(n, mean1, sd1), rnorm(n, mean2, sd1))) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(group = c(rep("Norwegian", n), rep("English", n))) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(group = factor(group)) %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  mutate(mean = mean(time),
         cil = DescTools::MeanCI(time, conf.level=0.95)[2],
         ciu = DescTools::MeanCI(time, conf.level=0.95)[3]) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(t = t.test(time ~ group, conf.level=0.95)[1],
         df = t.test(time ~ group, conf.level=0.95)[2],
         p = t.test(time ~ group, conf.level=0.95)[3]) %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  mutate(ttest = paste0("t: ", round(t, 2), ", df: ", round(df, 1), ", p-value: ", round(p, 4))) %>%
  select(-t, -df, -p)  -> pdat
ggplot(pdat, aes(x = time, group = group, color = group, linetype = group)) +
  geom_density(aes(alpha = .9)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  geom_point(aes(x = mean, y = 0.05, group= group)) +  
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = cil, xmax = ciu, y = 0.05, height = .005)) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(60, 140), ylim = c(0, ylim)) +
  ggplot2::annotate("text", x = 120, y = 0.05, label = unique(pdat$ttest)) +
  labs(title = paste0("2 groups (N = ", n, " sampled from ", pop, " (with means and CIs)\n", effect, " effect (mean(s): ", mean1, "; ", mean2, ", sd: ", sd1, ", Cohen's d: ", d, ")!"),
       x = "", y = "Probability")
}
```

```{r displot1, echo = F}
distplot(mean1 = 100, mean2 = 100, sd1 = 10, n = 30, pop = "the same population")
```

![2 groups from 1 distribution](https://github.com/MartinSchweinberger/AcqVAPowerRWS/images/dist01.png)

Now, lets have a look at at the distribution of two different groups (group has a weak effect, Cohen's *d* = .2)

```{r weak, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
distplot(mean1 = 99, mean2 = 101, sd1 = 10, n = 30, d = .2, effect = "weak", seed = 111)
```


![2 groups from 2 distribution (weak effect)](https://github.com/MartinSchweinberger/AcqVAPowerRWS/images/dist02.png)

Now, lets have a look at at the distribution of two different groups (group has a medium effect, Cohen's *d* = .5)

```{r medium, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
distplot(mean1 = 97.5, mean2 = 102.5, sd1 = 10, n = 30, d = 0.5, effect = "medium", seed = 222)
```

Now, lets have a look at at the distribution of two different groups (group has a strong effect, Cohen's *d* = .8)

```{r strong, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
distplot(mean1 = 96, mean2 = 104, sd1 = 10, n = 30, d = 0.8, effect = "strong", seed = 444, ylim = 0.08)
```


Now, lets have a look at at the distribution of two different groups (group has a very strong effect, Cohen's *d* = 1.2)

```{r vstrong, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
distplot(mean1 = 94, mean2 = 106, sd1 = 10, n = 30, d = 1.2, effect = "very strong", seed = 555)
```

**If variability and sample size remain constant, larger effects are easier to detect than smaller effects!**

## Sample size{-}

And let's now look at sample size.


```{r n30, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
distplot(mean1 = 97.5, mean2 = 102.5, sd1 = 10, n = 30, d = 0.5, effect = "medium", seed = 666)
```


Let us now increase the sample size to N = 50.


```{r n50, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
distplot(mean1 = 97.5, mean2 = 102.5, sd1 = 10, n = 50, d = 0.5, effect = "medium", seed = 777)
```

**If variability and effect size remain constant, effects are easier to detect with increasing sample size!**

## Variability{-}

And let's now look at variability.


```{r sd10, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
distplot(mean1 = 97.5, mean2 = 102.5, sd1 = 10, n = 30, d = 0.5, effect = "medium", seed = 888)
```

Let's decrease the variability to sd = 5.

```{r sd5, echo = F, warning=F, message=F}
distplot(mean1 = 97.5, mean2 = 102.5, sd1 = 5, n = 30, d = 0.5, effect = "medium", ylim = 0.125, seed = 999)
```

**If the sample and effect size remain constant, effects are easier to detect with decreasing variability!**

**In summary**, there are three main factors that determine if a model finds an effect. The accuracy (i.e., the probability of finding an effect):

* the size of the effect (bigger effects are easier to detect)
* the variability of the effect (less variability makes it easier to detect an effect), and 
* the sample size (the bigger the sample size, the easier it is to detect an effect); 
  + number of subjects/participants
  + number of items/questions
  + number of observations per item within subjects/participants
  
Now, if a) we dealing with a very big effect, then we need only few participants and few items to accurately find this effect.

Or b) if we dealing with an effect that has low variability (it is observable for all subjects with the same strength), then we need only few participants and few items to accurately find this effect.

# Today's Data{-}


We will use 3 data sets, two data sets that Yulia provided and one that was send in by Isabel. The publications associated with the data are:

The Accent data (already published): 

Kupisch, Tanja, Nadine Kolb, Yulia Rodina, and Olga Urek. 2021. Foreign Accent in Pre- and Primary School Heritage Bilinguals. *Languages* 6(2), 96; https://doi.org/10.3390/languages6020096

And the L2 English intervention data (which is still in progress):

Nygaard, Maren, Chistopher Loe Olsen, and Yulia Rodina. In progress. The effect of form-focused intervention on subject-verb agreement in L1 Norwegian L2 English learners.

In addition, we will use a data set that is part of the `likert` package and a data set that Isabel provided for the mixed-model effects visualization.

Here are summaries of the data sets:

1. **`AJT_V2`** (we will call this data `regdata`: contains 2103 observations of the following 14 variables:
  + ID: n = 2103 (0% missing)
  + Sentence: 24 levels
  + Group: 2 levels, namely *English* (n = 1193) and *NorwegianEnglish* (n = 910)
  + WordOrder: 2 levels, namely *V2* (n = 1054) and *V3* (n = 1049)
  + SentenceType: 2 levels, namely *NonSubjectInitial* (n = 1053) and *SentenceAdverbials* (n = 1050)


# Basic Power Analysis{-}

Let's start with a simple power analysis to see how power analyses work for simpler or basic statistical tests such as t-test, $\chi$^2^-test, or linear regression.

The `pwr` package [@pwr] implements power analysis as outlined by @cohen1988statistical and  allows to perform power analyses for the following tests (selection):

* balanced one way ANOVA (`pwr.anova.test`) 

* chi-square test (`pwr.chisq.test`)

* Correlation (`pwr.r.test`)

* general linear model (`pwr.f2.test`)
 	
* paired (one and two sample) t-test (`pwr.t.test`)

* two sample t-test with unequal N (`pwr.t2n.test`)

For each of these functions, you enter three of the four parameters (effect size, sample size, significance level, power) and the fourth is calculated. 

So how does this work? Have a look at the code chunk below.

Let check how to calculate the necessary sample size for each group for a one-way ANOVA that compares 5 groups and that has a power of 0.80 (80 percent), when the effect size is moderate (*f* = 0.25) and the significance level is 0.05 (5 percent)..

```{r bp01, warning=F, message=F}
# load package
library(pwr)
# calculate minimal sample size
pwr.anova.test(k=5,            # 5 groups are compared
               f=.25,          # moderate effect size
               sig.level=.05,  # alpha/sig. level = .05
               power=.8)       # confint./power = .8
```

In this case, the minimum number of participants in each group would be 40.

Let's check how we could calculate the power if we had already collected data (with 30 participants in each group) and we want to report the power of our analysis (and et us assume that the effect sie was medium).

```{r bp02, warning=F, message=F}
# calculate minimal sample size
pwr.anova.test(k=5,            # 5 groups are compared
               f=.25,          # moderate effect size
               sig.level=.05,  # alpha/sig. level = .05
               n=30)           # n of participants
```

In this case our analysis would only have a power or 66.8 percent. This means that we would only detect a medium sized effect in 66.7 percent of cases (which is considered insufficient).

## Exercise{-}

Given what you have learned above, what are the minimum number of participants per group to detect medium sized effects with an 80 percent accuracy for the following tests:

* general linear model

```{r ex1, eval = F}
# general linear model
pwr.f2.test()
```

* paired t-test

```{r ex2, eval = F}
# general linear model
pwr.t.test()
```

* 2 sample t-test

```{r ex3, eval = F}
# general linear model
pwr.t2n.test()
```

* $\chi$^2^-test

```{r ex4, eval = F}
# general linear model
pwr.chisq.test()
```


# Advanced Power Analysis{-}

The basis for the present tutorial is @green2016simr (which you can find [here](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.12504)). @green2016simr is a highly recommendable and thorough tutorial on performing power analysis in R. Recommendable literature on this topic are, e.g. @arnold2011simulation and @johnson2015power and [this tutorial](https://www.journalofcognition.org/articles/10.5334/joc.10/).

<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>
<b>NOTE</b><br>Power analysis have also been used post-hoc to test if the sample size of studies was sufficient to detect meaningful effects. However, such post-hoc power calculations where the target effect size comes from the data, give misleading results [@hoenig2001abuse; @perugini2018practical] and should thus be treated with extreme care!</p>

<br>

Before we conduct a study, we should figure out, what sample we need to detect a small/medium effect with medium variability so that our model is sufficient to detect this kind of effect. In order to do this, we would generate a data set that mirrors the kind of data that we expect to get (with the properties that we expect to get). We can then fit a model to this data and check if a model would be able to detect the expected effect. However, because a single model does not tell us that much (ift could simply be luck that it happened to find the effect), we run many different models on variations of the data and see how many of them find the effect. As a general rule of thumb, we want a data set that allows a model to find a medium sized effect with at least an accuracy of 80 percent [@field2007making].

In the following, we will go through how to determine what sample size we need for an example analysis.


## Preparation and session set up{-}

As we we have installed the packages, we can activate them as shown below.

```{r prep2, message=FALSE} 
# load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(lme4)
library(sjPlot)
library(report)
library(simr)
```

Once you have installed R and RStudio and initiated the session by executing the code shown above, you are good to go.

## Using piloted data and a lmer{-}

Load data

```{r reg01, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load data
regdat <- readRDS(here::here("data", "sampledat.rda")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Group = ifelse(Group == "Norwegian-English", "NorwegianEnglish", "English"),
                Sentence_type = ifelse(Sentence_type == "Non-subject-initial", 
                                       "NonSubjectInitial", "SentenceAdverbials"),
                Sentence = stringr::str_remove_all(Sentence, "\\W")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate_if(is.character, factor) %>%
  dplyr::rename(WordOrder = Word_order,
                SentenceType = Sentence_type)
# inspect
head(regdat, 10);str(regdat)
```


Check how many levels we have.

```{r reg02, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
table(regdat$Group, regdat$WordOrder); 
table(regdat$Group, regdat$SentenceType); 
table(regdat$ID)
table(regdat$Sentence)
```

We could also add a response variable (but not now ;) )


### Generating the model{-}

Set effects and specify model parameters

* fixed effects (and intercept)

* random effects

* variance

```{r reg03}
# Intercept + slopes for fixed effects 
# (Group, Sentence_type, Word_order, and an interaction between Group * Sentence_type)
fixed <- c(.52, .52, .52, .52, .52)
# Random intercepts for Sentence and ID
#rand <- list(0.5, 0.1)
rand <- list(0.5)
# res. variance
res <- 2
```

Generate model

```{r reg04}
#model <- makeLmer(y ~ (1|Sentence) + (1|ID) + Group * Sentence_type + Word_order, fixef=fixed, VarCorr=rand, sigma=res, data=regdat)
m1 <- makeLmer(y ~ (1|Sentence) + Group * SentenceType + WordOrder, 
               fixef=fixed, 
               VarCorr=rand, 
               sigma=res, 
               data=regdat)
# inspect
m1
```

Inspect summary table

```{r reg05}
sjPlot::tab_model(m1)
```

**The summary table shows that the effects are correct but none of them are reported as being significant!**

### Power analysis{-}

Let us now check if the data is sufficient to detect the interaction between `Group` and `Sentence_type`.

```{r reg06}
sim_wo <- simr::powerSim(m1, 
                        nsim=10,
                        test = fcompare(y ~ WordOrder))
# inspect results
sim_wo
```

**The data is sufficient to detect a weak effect of `WordOrder` with `r sim_wo$x` percent accuracy**

**Why did I set the estimates to 0.52?**

Let us now inspect the effect sizes and see why I used 0.52 as an effect size in the model.

```{r reg08, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# extract fixed effect estimates
estimatesfixedeffects <- fixef(m1)
# convert estimates into odds ratios
exp(estimatesfixedeffects)
```

We will now check if the effect size [@chen2010big] 

* small effect (Cohen's d 0.2, OR = 1.68)

* medium effect (Cohen's d 0.5, OR = 3.47)

* strong effect  (Cohen's d 0.8, OR = 6.71)

### Power analysis for interactions{-}

Power Analysis: let's check if the data set has enough power to detect a weak effect for `Group * SentenceType`.

```{r reg10}
sim_gst <- simr::powerSim(m1, 
                          nsim=100, 
                          test = fcompare(y ~ Group * SentenceType))
# inspect
sim_gst
```

**The data is not sufficient to detect a weak effect of `Group * SentenceType` with `r sim_gst$x` percent accuracy**

## Extending Data{-}

We will now extend the data to see how many participants and sentences you need.


### Adding sentences{-}

```{r ext01, message=F, warning=F}
m1_as <- simr::extend(m1,
                      along="Sentence", 
                      n=50)
# inspect model
m1_as
```

Check power when using 60 sentences

```{r ext03, message=F, warning=F}
sim_m1_as_gst <- powerSim(m1_as, 
                   nsim=20, 
                   test = fcompare(y ~ Group * SentenceType))
# inspect
sim_m1_as_gst
```


Plot power curve

```{r ext04, results='hide', message = FALSE, warning=F}
pcurve_m1_as_gst <- simr::powerCurve(m1_as, 
                               test=fcompare(y ~ Group * SentenceType), 
                               along="Sentence",
                               nsim = 20, 
                               breaks=seq(10, 50, 10))
# show plot
plot(pcurve_m1_as_gst)
```


### Checking participants{-}

What about increasing the number of participants?

```{r ext05, message=F, warning=F}
m2 <- makeLmer(y ~ (1|ID) + Group * SentenceType + WordOrder, 
               fixef=fixed, 
               VarCorr=rand, 
               sigma=res, 
               data=regdat)
# inspect
sjPlot::tab_model(m2)
```


Power analysis

```{r ext08, message=F, warning=F}
sim_m2_wo <- powerSim(m2, 
                   nsim=10, 
                   test = fcompare(y ~ WordOrder))
# inspect
sim_m2_wo
```

An alternative way to perform the simulation

```{r ext09, message=F, warning=F}
# set seed for replicability
set.seed(12345)
# perform power analysis for present model
rsim_m2_wo <- powerSim(m2, fixed("WordOrderV3", "z"), nsim=10)
# inspect
rsim_m2_wo
```

Plotting the power curve.

```{r ext11, results='hide', message = FALSE, warning=F}
pcurve_m2_wo <- simr::powerCurve(m2, 
                               test=fcompare(y ~ WordOrder),
                               along = "ID", 
                               nsim=10)
# show plot
plot(pcurve_m2_wo)
```

## Generating data and a glmer{-}

In order to perform a  power analysis, we will start by loading the tidyverse package to process the data and by generating a data that we will use to determine the power of a regression model.

This simulated data set has

* 200 data points
* 2 Conditions (Control, Test)
* 10 Subjects
* 10 Items

```{r glmer01, message=F, warning=F}
# generate data
simdat <- data.frame(
  sub <- rep(paste0("Sub", 1:10), each = 20),
  cond <- rep(c(
    rep("Control", 10),
    rep("Test", 10))
    , 10),
  itm <- as.character(rep(1:10, 20))
) %>%
  dplyr::rename(Subject = 1,
                Condition = 2,
                Item = 3) %>%
  dplyr::mutate_if(is.character, factor)
# inspect
head(simdat, 15)
```


**EXERCISE**

Can you create a data set with 5 Subjects, 5 Items (each) for 4 Conditions?

```{r datex1, eval = F}

```

**Solution**

The first 20 rows of the data should look like shown below:

```{r datex2, echo = F}
# generate data
Items <- rep(rep(paste0("Item", 1:5), 4), 5)
Condition <- rep(rep(paste0("Condition", 1:4), each = 5), 5)
Subjects <- rep(paste0("Subject", 1:5), each = 20)
# combine into data frame
exdat <- data.frame(Subjects, Items, Condition)
# inspect
head(exdat, 20)
```




### Generating the model{-}

Set effects and specify model parameters

* fixed effects (and intercept)

* random effects

* variance

```{r glmer02, message=F, warning=F}
# Intercept + slopes for fixed effects 
# (Group, Sentence_type, Word_order, and an interaction between Group * Sentence_type)
fixed <- c(.52, .52)
# Random intercepts for Sentence and ID
rand <- list(0.5, 0.1)
#rand <- list(0.5)
```

Generate model


```{r glmer03, message=F, warning=F}
m4 <- simr::makeGlmer(y ~ (1|Subject) + (1|Item) + Condition, 
                      family = "binomial", 
                      fixef=fixed, 
                      VarCorr=rand, 
                      data=simdat)
# inspect
sjPlot::tab_model(m4)
```

Extract power

```{r glmer04, message=F, warning=F}
# set seed for replicability
set.seed(12345)
# perform power analysis for present model
rsim_m4_c <- powerSim(m4, fixed("ConditionTest", "z"), nsim=20)
# inspect
rsim_m4_c
```

## Extending the data{-}

### Adding Items{-}

* 2 Conditions

* 10 Subjects

* 40 Items (from 10)

(each combination occurs once!)

```{r glmer06, message=F, warning=F}
m4_ai <- simr::extend(m4,
                      along="Item", 
                      n=40)
# inspect model
sjPlot::tab_model(m4_ai)
```


Plot power curve

```{r glmer08}
pcurve_m4_ai_c <- powerCurve(m4_ai, 
                             fixed("ConditionTest", "z"), 
                             along = "Item",
                             nsim = 20,
                             breaks=seq(10, 40, 5), 
                             nsim=10)
# show plot
plot(pcurve_m4_ai_c)
```

### Adding subjects{-}

* 2 Conditions

* 10 Items

* 40 Subjects (from 10)

(each combination occurs once!)

```{r glmer10, message=F, warning=F}
m4_as <- simr::extend(m4,
                      along="Subject", 
                      n=40)
# inspect model
sjPlot::tab_model(m4_as)
```


Plot power curve

```{r glmer12}
pcurve_m4_as_c <- powerCurve(m4_as, 
                             fixed("ConditionTest", "z"), 
                             along = "Subject",
                             nsim = 20,
                             breaks=seq(10, 40, 5), 
                             nsim=10)
# show plot
plot(pcurve_m4_as_c)
```

How often does each *combination* occur?

**Only once!**

So, what if we increase the number of combinations? (**Repeated Measures Design!**)

* 2 Conditions

* 10 Items

* 10 Subjects 

(But each combination of item and subject now occurs 10 times!)

```{r glmer14}
m4_asi_c <- extend(m4, 
                   within="Subject+Item", 
                   n=10)
# perform power calculation
pcurve_m4_asi_c <- powerCurve(m4_asi_c, 
                              fixed("ConditionTest", "z"), 
                              within="Subject+Item",
                              nsim = 20,
                              breaks=seq(2, 10, 2), 
                              nsim=10)
# show plot
plot(pcurve_m4_asi_c)
```

### Adding subjects and items{-}

* 2 Conditions

* 30 Items (from 10)

* 30 Subjects (from 10)

(each combination occurs once!)

```{r glmer16, message=F, warning=F}
m4_as <- simr::extend(m4,
                      along="Subject", 
                      n=30)
m4_asi <- simr::extend(m4_as,
                      along="Item", 
                      n=30)
# inspect model
sjPlot::tab_model(m4_asi)
```


Plot power curve

*How many subjects do you need if you have 30 Items?*

```{r glmer18}
pcurve_m4_asi_c <- powerCurve(m4_asi, 
                             fixed("ConditionTest", "z"), 
                             along = "Subject", 
                             breaks=seq(5, 30, 5), 
                             nsim=10)
# show plot
plot(pcurve_m4_asi_c)
```

# Post-Hoc Analyses{-}

Adding a response variable

```{r glmer20}
simdat2 <- simdat %>%
  dplyr::arrange(Condition) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
  dep <- c(sample(c("AOI", "NotAOI"), 50, replace = T, prob = c(.5, .5)),
           sample(c("AOI", "NotAOI"), 50, replace = T, prob = c(.5, .5)),
           sample(c("AOI", "NotAOI"), 50, replace = T, prob = c(.5, .5)),
           sample(c("AOI", "NotAOI"), 50, replace = T, prob = c(.7, .3)))
  ) %>%
  dplyr::mutate_if(is.character, factor) %>%
  dplyr::rename(AOI = 4)
# inspect
head(simdat2, 20)
```


Now that we have generated some data, we will fit a model to it and perform a power analysis on the observed effects. 


We will fit a first model to the data. Thus, in a first step, we load the `lme4` package to create a model, set a seed (to save the results and so that the results can be replicated), and then create an initial mixed-effects model.

```{r pwr1, message=F, warning=F}
# set seed for replicability
set.seed(12345)
# fit model
m5 <- glmer(AOI ~ (1|Subject) +(1|Item) + Condition, family="binomial", data=simdat2)
# inspect results
summary(m5)
```

We now check the effect sizes of the predictors in the model. We can do this by displaying the results of the model using the `tab_model` function from the `sjPlot` package.


```{r pwr5, message=F, warning=F}
# tabulate results
sjPlot::tab_model(m5)
```


Now, we perform power analysis on an observed effect. This analysis tells us how likely the model is to find an observed effect given the data.

<p style='margin-top:1em; text-align:center'>
<b>NOTE</b><br>We use a very low number of simulations (100) and we use the default z-test which is suboptimal for small samples [@bolker2009generalized]. In a proper study, you should increase the number of simulations (to at least 1000) and you should use a bootstrapping rather than a z-test [cf. @halekoh2014kenward].</p>
<p style='margin-left:1em;'>
</p></span>
</div>

*What is the probability of finding the observed effect given the data?*

```{r pwr7, results='hide', message = FALSE, warning=F}
# set seed for replicability
set.seed(12345)
# perform power analysis for present model
rsim0 <- powerSim(m5, 
                  fixed("ConditionTest", "z"), 
                  nsim=10)
# inspect results
rsim0
```


The results of the power analysis show that, given the data at hand, the model would have detected the effect of `Conidition:Test` with a probability of `r rsim0$x` percent. However, and as stated above, the results of such post-hoc power calculations (where the target effect size comes from the data) give misleading results [@hoenig2001abuse] and should thus be treated with extreme care!

# Fixing effects


```{r pwr9, message=F, warning=F}
estimatesfixedeffects <- fixef(m5)
exp(estimatesfixedeffects)
```



We can see that the effect is rather small which makes it very hard to detect an effect. We will now change the size of the effect of ConditionTest to represent a truly small effect, i.e. on the brink of being noise but being just strong enough to be considered small. In other words, we will set the effect so that its odds ratio is exactly 1.68.


```{r}
# set seed for replicability
set.seed(12345)
# perform power analysis for small effect
fixef(m5)["ConditionTest"] <- 0.519
estimatesfixedeffects <- fixef(m5)
exp(estimatesfixedeffects)
```

*What is the probability of finding a weak effect given the data?*

Perform power analysis

```{r pwr11, results='hide', message = FALSE, warning=F}
# set seed for replicability
set.seed(12345)
# perform power analysis for present model
rsim0 <- powerSim(m5, 
                  fixed("ConditionTest", "z"), 
                  nsim=20)
# inspect results
rsim0
```

# Power Analysis of Extended Data

We will now extend the data to see what sample size is needed to get to the 80 percent accuracy threshold. We begin by increasing the number of items from 10 to 30 to see if this would lead to a sufficient sample size.


```{r pwr13, results='hide', message = FALSE, warning=F}
# increase sample size
m5_ai <- extend(m5, 
             along="Item", 
             n=30)
# perform power simulation
rsim2 <- powerSim(m5_ai, 
                  fixed("ConditionTest", "z"), 
                  nsim=10)
# show results
rsim2
```
